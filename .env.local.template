# YouTube API Configuration using Service Account

# RECOMMENDED METHOD: Environment Variable with JSON content
# This works in all environments (development, staging, production)
# Copy the entire JSON content from your downloaded service account file:
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"your-key-id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour-Private-Key-Content-Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"your-client-id","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs/your-service-account%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}

# ALTERNATIVE METHOD: File path (only for local development)
# Place your service account JSON file in the project root and reference it:
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./google-service-account.json

# Optional: Explicitly set project ID (usually auto-detected from service account)
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
# ✅ Set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON in your hosting platform's environment variables
# ✅ Never commit this file to version control
# ✅ Use different service accounts for different environments
# ✅ Monitor your Google Cloud Console for API usage
